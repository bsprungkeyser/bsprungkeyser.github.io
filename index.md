I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/). Professor [Wyatt Lloyd](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wlloyd/) and I are tackling interesting research problems spanning distributed systems, databases, and computer networks.

Prior to attending Princeton, I earned a Master's in Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), where I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Srini Seshan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/) and [Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/). I also spent a few years in industry, and before that, I earned my BA from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/) with a double major in Computer Science and Economics.

I help organize Princeton's [Systems Lunch Seminar](http://sns.cs.princeton.edu/seminar/). If you are interested in giving a talk, please send me an email.
